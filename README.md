# AI sentiment for stocks
Machine learning project to track the sentiment of stocks

## 1. Project Description
This is a personal project that is made to track the sentiment of stocks. Once logged in, 
You can head over to the "Stock Sentiment" tab, where you can input any Ticker, and using
the Headlines found about that stock on Yahoo Finance, it will return the positive, negative, 
and neutral sentiment surrounding the stock. It will then save that data to a database and 
show a graph in which it will show your result in relation to other times the stock has been 
searched.

### What I hope to add
Though I felt this project was good enough to post on GitHub, I do not consider this project 
anywhere close to a finished product. I hope to include some of these features in the near future:

* Database for accounts so that you can sign up and your login will be remembered
* More engaging app with colors and more interactive widgets
*
